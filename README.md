# lethal_to_company
I've wrote [a blog post](https://vxcall.github.io/posts/the-fundamentals-of-hacking-unity/) about this repo to remember things.

A wall hack cheat / hack / mod for Lethal Company.
Since this is my first time tackling Unity game, I dont guarantee the quality of code or performance.

Press ESC and open menu once to get GUI rendered because I think is the rendering function kicks in after that.

## Contents
the wallhack works for 
- Enemy
- Items

## prerequisite
- Inject the dll using [SharpMonoInjector](https://github.com/warbler/SharpMonoInjector). the info it needs to work is following:
  - class name: loader
  - method name: load

## tested version
tested with game version v40 and v45 (You can check it in the game's main menu)

## Reference
- [How to Hack Unity - Mono Injection & CodeStage Anticheat](https://guidedhacking.com/threads/how-to-hack-unity-mono-injection-codestage-anticheat.17915/)
- [This UC post](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/3921191-post32.html) saved me from the situation where the WorldToScreenPoint func of the player.gameplayCamera didn't work as I expected.
